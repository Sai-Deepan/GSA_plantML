# GSA PlantML: ML based Plant Disease Detection

**GSA PlantML** is a lightweight desktop application that uses Google Vision Pro model and Trained ML model to detect plant diseases from leaf images.  
Built with a simple and elegant GUI, it allows users to upload or capture images, analyze plant health, and receive instant disease predictions with confidence scores.

---

## Features

* Detects plant diseases from leaf images using a trained ML model.
* Built in Google vision pro model to suggest possible cure.
* Interactive **CustomTkinter** GUI for smooth user experience.
* Displays **confidence percentage** for predictions.
* Supports both **image upload** and **camera capture**.
*

## Project Structure

* `main.py` – Core plant disease detection logic using TensorFlow / Keras.
* `app.py` – GUI built with CustomTkinter integrating image upload, camera, and prediction display.
* `camera_module.py` – Handles live image capture from webcam.
* `plant_classes.txt` – List of supported plant disease classes.
* `dataset/` – Dataset used for training and fine-tuning.
* `images/` – GUI assets, icons, and example plant images.

### Usage

#### Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

* Upload or capture a leaf image.
* View the predicted disease and confidence percentage instantly.

## Supported Plant Diseases

* Tomato Leaf Blight
* Corn Leaf Spot
* Potato Early Blight
* Healthy Leaf (No Disease)

And 23 other diseases listed in plant_classes.txt file

*(Easily extendable by retraining the model with new datasets.)*

## Why GSA PlantML?

GSA PlantML helps farmers and researchers identify plant diseases quickly and accurately — without needing complex lab tools.
It runs offline, making it practical for rural and low-connectivity areas, and can be expanded for various crop types.
